            <p>Now I will discuss 5 steps that can be followed to bring a beautiful solution to the Socio-Emotional Conflict. Those are, Dysfunctional Person - We need to find out who the dysfunctional person is. There may be one or more. Right Question to the Right Person - Then we have to find the problems by asking the right people the right questions. Alignment - Then you have to sit down with everyone and come to the alignment and try to solve the problem together. Allies - Everyone needs to be involved in the implementation of their goals and objectives so that this problem can be solved immediately. New Habit - And at the end of the day we need to develop some new habits so that everyone can practice it well and keep the environment beautiful. And you may have realized by now that we are following this structure through this meeting and moving towards a solution ourselves. Now comes the new habit. What could be the new habit? I will say that in the next slide.
